# TODO
As I am likely to forget what I was doing the last time I worked on this project, I need this file to know what to do after.
You can just forget this file.

## ASAP
Change viewport for each resize of the window to make it fit in.

## Peripherals
Make the customs objets for the mouse/keyboard and, with a bit of luck, controller.

## GUI
Continue the GameTexLoader (scan the Assets folder and import all the textures)
Remove ALL occurencies of OpenGL outside the Graphics folder.

## Rooms
Create the generator (breadth-first fill)

Just a test of a game framework using the OpenTK/OpenGL libraries.

You can find the OpenTK project [here](https://github.com/opentk/opentk).

## Versions

Version | Build name | Update
------- | ------- | -------
`v0.1.0` | `El-Bridget` | State managing/loading and prety much all the project itself.
`v0.1.1` | `El-Bridget` | Floor generation & some other useless stuff.

## Structure
I will not detail all the code parts, but I will just give an overview of it.
All those files are in the ~/Pulsee1 folder. 

Folder | What it is
------- | -------
`Controls` | Handle all the control related code: physical device interpreter, key binding, event handler.
`Display` | Handle all the GUI + graphics related code: container(Window class/resolution) and the camera (inside Window).
`Game` | Contains all the game content: states / generators / MOBS etc.
`KernelContent` | Contains all the pictures and screens used by the engine itself.
`Utilities` | A bunch of useful classes to display in the console with colors, generate a random integer, use LERP, check if number is even, easy text file reader and so on...
